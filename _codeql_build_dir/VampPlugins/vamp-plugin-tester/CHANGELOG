Changes in Vamp Plugin Tester v1.1 since the previous release v1.0:

Features

 * Add mechanism for listing the available tests and running only a
   single test at a time
 
 * Add test for reset() changing effective parameter values
 
 * Add test for existence of .cat file

 * Add test for boilerplate description text still in place for VamPy
   plugins
 
 * Make output more informative for some tests, and make some tests faster

Bug fixes

 * Fix erroneous verbose timestamp output for some tests

 * Don't complain when two consecutive runs with different starting
   times produce the same results, if neither set of results has any
   timestamps anyway

 * Link against pthread library on Linux, to support plugins with
   threading
