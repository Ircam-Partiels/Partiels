**[Partiels](https://github.com/Ircam-Partiels/Partiels)** is a software suite for **analysing and exploring the content and characteristics** of sounds.

<p align="center"><img src="BinaryData/Resource/Partiels-v2.0.0-Sample-v2.gif"></p>

## Features

Partiels allows **analysis** of one or several audio files using Vamp plug-ins **loading** data files, **visualizing**, **editing**, **organizing**, and **exporting** the results as images or text files that can be used in other applications such as Max, Pure Data, Open Music, etc.

- Windows, Mac & Linux support
- Multiformat support
- Multichannel support
- Multiaudiofile support
- Analyzing audio with Vamp plug-ins
- Visualizing results as spectrogram, lines, and markers
- Textual and graphical editing of results 
- Organizing and ordering analyses in groups
- Exporting results to PNG, JPEG, CSV, LAB, JSON, CUE, REAPER & SDIF formats
- Loading results from CSV, LAB, JSON, CUE & SDIF formats
- Batch processing
- Command line interface to analyze, export, and convert results
- Consolidating documents for sharing

Alongside Partiels, a wide range of analyses based on audio engines developed at IRCAM and outside are ported to Vamp plug-ins. These plug-ins allow you to perform FFT, LPC, transient, fundamental, formant, tempo, TTS and many other analyses. You can also find a large number of analysis plug-ins on the [Vamp plug-ins website](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/).

> For bug reports or feature requests, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Ircam-Partiels/Partiels/issues) on this Github repository. For more general feedback and questions, you can create a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Ircam-Partiels/discussions) on this Github repository or on the [IRCAM forum](https://discussion.forum.ircam.fr/).

## Compatibility

Partiels is compatible on MacOS 10.13 and higher (Universal 2 - Intel/Silicon), Windows 10 & 11, and Linux.

<p align="center"><img src="BinaryData/Resource/Partiels-Compatibility.png"></p>

> ⚠️ Some Vamp plugins may not support the same configurations and may have other restrictions.

## Compilation

The compilation system is based on [CMake](https://cmake.org/). On macOS, you can use the XCode generator with the command `cmake -G Xcode`. On Windows, you can use the Visual Studio generator with the command `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`. On Linux, you can use the Makefile or Ninja generators with the commands `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"` or `cmake -G Ninja`, using Clang or GCC as the compiler.

Here is an example:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ircam-Partiels/Partiels.git
cd partiels
cmake . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # Example using Ninja generator; use XCode on macOS or Visual Studio on Windows.
cmake --build build
ctest -C Debug -VV --test-dir build # Note: The `-VV` flag is optional and provides verbose output for debugging purposes.
```

> ⚠️ For Linux, JUCE dependencies must be installed: Refer to the file [JUCE/docs/Linux Dependencies.md](<JUCE/docs/Linux Dependencies.md>).

> 💡 You can refer to the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for compilation instructions. 

## Releases

Partiels uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases. Releases can be created in two ways:

### Automatic Release (Tag-based)

The release is created when a new tag is pushed (e.g., `2.1.0`). This is the preferred approach for final stable releases. The CI workflow automatically:
- Builds the project in Release mode
- Creates a draft release with the tag name
- Uploads all platform-specific installers and documentation

```bash
git tag 2.1.0
git push origin 2.1.0
```

### Manual Release (Workflow Dispatch)

You can also manually trigger a release build from the GitHub Actions UI. This is the preferred approach for testing releases, allowing you to create releases without pushing tags and providing flexibility for testing builds.

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Ircam-Partiels/Partiels/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Configure the workflow inputs:
   - **Create a release**: Enable to create a GitHub release
   - **Version name**: Specify the version (e.g., `2.1.0-rc1`)
   - **Build type**: Choose `Release` or `Debug`

> 💡 The CI workflow also automatically detects `[debug]` in commit messages to build in Debug mode for regular commits.
